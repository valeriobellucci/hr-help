The question
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees and they have the following question:
What’s likely to make the employee leave the company?

Goal of this project
Analyze the data collected by the HR department to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
